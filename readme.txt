First of all, thank you for downloading and using MTA DayZ. This means a lot to us, as it shows that our work and dedication
will not be in vain. This README aims to show you everything about MTA DayZ, including how to set it up and what commands
are available for admins.

## SETTING UP THE MTA DAYZ SERVER ##
Once you have moved the contents of mtadayz.zip to the resources folder, open acl.xml and add the following lines in the admin group:

    <object name="resource.DayZ"></object>
    <object name="resource.login"></object>
    <object name="resource.slothbot"></object>
    <object name="user.[YOUR_NAME]"></object>
    
    You need edit "[YOUR_NAME]" per your nickname in game for playing with your admin rights.
    
Now open mtaserver.conf, scroll down and add these lines:

    <resource src="DayZ" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
    <resource src="login" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
    <resource src="slothbot" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
	
The following resources should have startup set to 0:

scoreboard, mapcycler, mapmanager, spawnmanager, votemanager

Version 0.9.0 will hopefully be the last version to do that, but you must replace your current internal.db with the fresh one provided
in the download! It's located in the same directory as mtaserver.conf and acl.xml.

And that's it! Start the server and MTA DayZ will start automatically.

/add <admin/supporter/remove> <Player>

## FAQ ##
Q: Help! Vehicles won't spawn/appear!
A: Check the vehicles database. Does it contain any entries? If not, delete the vehicleManager from the console (delaccount vehicleManager) and restart the server.

Q: Error/Warning X is appearing in the server console!
A: Please post your server log in the forum: http://mta-dayz.org/forum

Q: What just happened?! I have been kicked when I tried to enter my Rhino!
A: The anticheat measures prevent players who are not admins (ACL-wise) from entering vehicles which do not normally spawn via the MTA DayZ script.

Q: The inventory is broken!
A: Please provide a screenshot/video/accurate description of what exactly broke. Add server log and, if possible, the client log too.

Q: I'm getting this strange error: "Infinite/too long execution (DayZ)".
A: This error appears when items are respawning. We are trying to reduce lag as much as possible, but sometimes, the server is struggling with respawning said items.
Usually, it should dissipate after a few minutes, but if the error persists, try restarting the server. In general, it is advised to restart the server
every 24-48 hours to prevent possible, yet undetected memory leaks.

Q: How to change backpack slots in this gamemode ?
A: You can do this by modifying the configuration file "cfgServer.lua" (DayZ/configs/cfgServer.lua). Take care to change the "maxslots" variable in the file "cfgSecurity.lua" (DayZ/configs/cfgSecurity.lua) for the anti-cheat.

Q: I want to help developing! How and where can I apply?
A: Send a private message to Lawliet on the MTA forum. Read this topic before you apply: https://forum.multitheftauto.com/viewtopic.php?f=108&t=88188

Q: There is a question I have that does not appear in the FAQ!
A: Go to the forum http://mta-dayz.org/forum, and ask there. We'll answer. Eventually.
